OverlayMenu
===========

A library that implements the typical i'm Watch Overlay Menu.

## Installation

Just clone the repository on your computer, then reference the `OverlayMenu` Android Library project from your project. The repository contains both [Eclipse][1] and [IntelliJ IDEA][2] project files for the library project.

## Usage

In order to implement the Overlay Menu in your project, you have to follow these steps:

  1. Use a theme whose parent is `Theme.ImWatch` for the app, or the `Activities` where the `OverlayMenu` is used.
  2. Create a wrapper layout containing both the `OverlayMenu` and the actual layout (you can check out the sample project for an example of this, in `/res/layout/main_wrapper.xml`).
